# Image-feature-extraction-SURF
Feature extraction using Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF)
Different types of attacks on image

Results and Analysis: Using hausdorff distance we can analyze which
attack gives more variation in features between the input image and the output image

Rotation(5)=0
Salt and pepper(0.01)=0.1661
Speckel(0.01)=0.1403
Gaussian(0.005)=0.1661
Traslate(5x5)=0.1977
jpeg(10)=0.1654

Conclusion
Thus we understood and analyzed the feature extraction technique using SURF .
Alongside a noise analysis between original and attacted image are measured
for different types of noise and its parameters.
